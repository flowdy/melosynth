Sompyler
========

This is an off-line (not a real-time) synthesizer for sound design,
as well as for symphony and song composition. However, it is pre-alpha
and cannot fulfill that claim, yet. Of course, I could just *use* other
well elaborated and proven software synthesizers like Csound, but programing
yet another alternative is much more fun. So, as yet it is just a way of mine
to learn Python, as well as theory of acoustics and music at once.

Basics
------

There are a bunch of definition files that are used to describe the
audio output into a wave file.

  1. Tone system and mapping. In the distribution there is a file to define
     the common tune of 440Hz for the 49th key (A4) with 12 tone steps per
     octave. Use that to play western music. These settings accord to the MIDI
     standard. 88 notes can be referenced by english or german names.

  2. (TODO) Orchestra: Which instruments are situated where on virtual stage. 

  3. Instruments: Their sound character (overall "timbre") and variations
     thereof that take effect depending on the properties of a played note.
     The character is specified in multiple dimensions:

       * Partials have a frequency relative to the base frequency of a tone.
         Ideally the factor is integer, but slight deviation in cent can be
         specified.

       * Each partial has its share of the volume, specified on the logarhithmic
         scale normalized to 100 dB. So, e.g. a partial with a share of 80dB
         has the tenth of the sound pressure of a partial with 100dB.

       * Each partial has its own ASR envelope, that is actually defined as a
         bezier curve. Whether an optional decay part is integrated in the attack
         or the sustain phase is to be considered carefully. Bezier curves should
         make for a smoother impression than the conventional linear and artificial
         ADSR envelope that is not very natural (nothing in nature is truly linear).
         Plus, a partial can be modified by frequency modulation, amplitude
         modulation (both shapable too), wave shaping.

       * (TODO) Variations are interpolated based on scalar properties of a note,
         like base frequency or stress.

       * (TODO) Variations can also be selected based on discrete properties, e.g.
         if the sustain pedal of a piano is pressed.

     As yet, sound generators can be defined. [Learn how](doc/instrument-definition.md)

  4. (TODO) Score files: One file for each bar/measure defines which instruments play
     which note with what pitch, what length and offset from zero position in that
     bar, and optionally other properties like an own frequency modulation shape.

System requirements
-------------------

### Software

Besides of Python 2.7.x (as a Python newbie I postpone rewrite for 3.x, since
version 2.x is more present in my job and self-confusion is not very much fun)
one needs only two packages :

  * PyYAML
  * Numpy

While the sompyler is in alpha state, I rather focus development of core features
than getting it to run on other systems than mine, which is a Debian GNU/Linux.

Sufficiently fast CPU and much RAM (at least 1G, depending on the length of the
score you want to compile) is recommended since sound data is purely calculated
i.e. without external sound fonts and things like that.

TODO
----

As of May 12th, 2017 I intend to elaborate

    - Test and debug sympartial interpolation
    - Parse full instrument character specification from YAML text
    - Read scores from YAML text.

Below license is preliminary:

When switching from pre-alpha to alpha, I will also choose an open-source license.
Not before then I welcome anybody to fork my project. That is, I do not want anybody
to fork it, yet (of course, technically I cannot prevent that, to even try would be quite
ridicule).

When switching from pre-alpha to alpha, I will start version numbering, supply a
setup.py, test routines, and a proper license. Since then I will also keep master
branch stable and functioning.

I currently publish on GitHub for the sole purposes of a) an external backup and b)
to inform others what I am doing. Use by others beyond just reading the sources
to learn from my errors is something I no more than condone. So please do not
count on my support or hold me liable for whatever you might suffer from using it.
